# Rocky Linux with the Nvidia driver

This container definition demonstrates building a Rocky Linux based container
incorporating the Nvidia driver for Nvidia GPU support.

The container may be built with Podman.

```shell

podman build .
```

The host that builds the container does _not_ need to have a GPU installed.
